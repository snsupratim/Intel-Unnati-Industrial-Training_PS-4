# 🏥 Intel-Unnati-Industrial-Training_PS-4 — EduRAG

EduRAG is a **document-aware intelligent assistant** built to enable **accurate question answering and insight generation from unstructured PDF documents** such as reports, manuals, policies, and research files.
The system strictly answers queries and generates insights **only from user-uploaded documents**, ensuring **no hallucination and no external knowledge leakage**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

### Problem Statement – 4: Convert Enterprise PDFs into Searchable Knowledge

Enterprises maintain thousands of PDF documents such as reports, manuals, research papers, and policies. Searching for specific information inside these documents is challenging because the data is largely **unstructured** and often spread across pages, tables, and images.

The objective of this project is to build a tool that **converts PDFs into structured, searchable knowledge**, enabling efficient retrieval and accurate question answering.

### Key Requirements Addressed

- Properly read PDFs, including **scanned PDFs using OCR**, while preserving document structure and flow
- Chunk documents into **meaningful sections without breaking chapters or context**
- Store extracted textual content in a **Vector Database (Pinecone)** for semantic search
- Extract tables and store them in a **searchable vector representation** (instead of a separate NoSQL store)
- Handle images and charts by generating **short textual descriptions** so they are also searchable

### Not in Scope (as per implementation)

- Handwritten or very low-quality scan handling
- Deep data extraction from complex charts

### Stretch Goals Achieved

- ✅ **Multilingual document support** using multilingual embeddings

---

## 🧩 Solution Overview

EduRAG implements an end-to-end **PDF-to-Knowledge RAG pipeline** with user authentication. The overall flow is:

1. User authenticates into the system
2. User uploads one or more PDF documents
3. Documents are processed using OCR (if required), chunked, and indexed into Pinecone
4. User selects a document as the active context
5. User can:

   - Ask document-specific questions in the **Chat** section
   - Generate **summaries and insights** from the selected document in the **Insights** section

All responses are generated **strictly from the selected document context**, ensuring reliability and zero hallucination.
